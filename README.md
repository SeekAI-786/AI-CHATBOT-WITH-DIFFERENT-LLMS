## üìñ Hugging Face Models

Here are the **models** hosted on Hugging Face that are used in the demo:

1. **Llama-3.2-1B-Lora-Fine-Tune-FineTome**  
   Model URL: [Llama-3.2-1B-Lora-Fine-Tune-FineTome](https://huggingface.co/Muhammad7865253/llama-3.2-1B-Lora-Fine_Tune-FineTome)  
   - This model excels in handling **medical-related queries** and provides specialized responses for healthcare topics.

2. **Gemma-Mental-Health-Fine-Tune**  
   Model URL: [Gemma-Mental-Health-Fine-Tune](https://huggingface.co/Muhammad7865253/gemma-mental-health-fine-tune)  
   - This model is ideal for **mental health-related conversations**, offering insights, therapy suggestions, and emotional support.

3. **Qwen-1.5B-Medical-QA**  
   Model URL: [Qwen-1.5B-Medical-QA](https://huggingface.co/Muhammad7865253/qwen-1.5B-medical-QA)  
   - This model is designed for **medical question-answering** tasks, with high accuracy for healthcare-related inquiries.

## üåê Streamlit Interface

The web app for interacting with the models is available at:  
[Streamlit App URL](https://medibotcustomgpt-eepnvsgmhzcrmzbiuwdgp4.streamlit.app/)

*Note*: Due to limited resources on Streamlit, the **fine-tuned models** could not be hosted directly on the platform. The app demonstrates how the models work via Hugging Face‚Äôs API, providing a similar experience.
